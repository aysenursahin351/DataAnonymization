# DataAnonymization

A console application was made using unique value, fake data and hash methods as data anonymization methods. 
In this application, Python was used as the language and PyCharm and Jupyter Notebook as the IDE. 
The test results were taken from both IDEs and tested in different environments. 
It has been noticed that it should have certain versions while running on IDEs. 
Adjustments have been made accordingly. Test trials were conducted on 5 datasets on the Kaggle site.
